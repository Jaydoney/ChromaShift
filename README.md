# ChromaShift

A Python script that can aid individuals with different types of dichromacy, including protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia, by receiving image input via the terminal, converting images into a corrected format that will allow those with colour vision deficiency to distinguish between colours better by applying mathematical algorithms. This script compensates for weak or missing cones by simulating color blindness to then determine which LMS colours need to be mathematically adjusted and then saves the colour-corrected image within the script's directory. 

Within this repository's files, we have several examples of original images, along with the corrected images. Feel free to compare the differences between them at https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/.
